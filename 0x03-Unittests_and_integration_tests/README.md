# 0x03. Unittests and Integration Tests

This directory contains exercises and examples for writing unit tests and integration tests in Python. The focus is on testing functions, classes, and modules to ensure code correctness and reliability.

## Contents

- **test_utils.py**: Unit tests for utility functions, including parameterized tests.
- **utils.py**: Utility functions to be tested.
- **Other test files**: Additional tests for integration and edge cases.

## Concepts Covered

- Writing unit tests using `unittest`
- Parameterized testing with `parameterized`
- Testing nested data structures
- Integration testing strategies

## Usage

To run the tests, use:

```
python -m unittest discover
```

or run a specific test file:

```
python -m unittest test_utils.py
```
